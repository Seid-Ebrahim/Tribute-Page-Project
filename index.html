            <h3>Albert Einstein Timeline</h3>
             <ul>
            <li><strong>1879</strong> - Born in Ulm, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire.</li>
            <li><strong>1884</strong> - Receives a compass from his father, sparking his curiosity about the natural world.</li>
            <li><strong>1895</strong> - At 16, fails his entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, but passes the following year.</li>
            <li><strong>1901</strong> - Renounces German citizenship to avoid military service; becomes a Swiss citizen.</li>
            <li><strong>1902</strong> - Takes a job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. While working there, he continues his independent studies in physics.</li>
            <li><strong>1905</strong> - Publishes four groundbreaking papers in "Annalen der Physik," revolutionizing modern physics. These include his work on the photoelectric effect, special relativity, Brownian motion, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc²). This year is known as his "Annus Mirabilis" or "Miracle Year."</li>
            <li><strong>1909</strong> - Leaves the Patent Office to become a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.</li>
            <li><strong>1915</strong> - Completes the General Theory of Relativity, fundamentally altering our understanding of gravity and the universe.</li>
            <li><strong>1919</strong> - During a solar eclipse, his theory is confirmed by observations of light bending around the Sun, catapulting him to international fame.</li>
            <li><strong>1921</strong> - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect, not for relativity, as it was still considered controversial.</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Emigrates to the United States due to the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany. Accepts a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</li>
            <li><strong>1939</strong> - Signs a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, alerting him to the possibility of Nazi Germany developing an atomic bomb, which leads to the creation of the Manhattan Project.</li>
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - Becomes a U.S. citizen while retaining his Swiss citizenship.</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - Declines the offer to become the president of Israel.</li>
            <li><strong>1955</strong> - Dies at the age of 76 in Princeton, New Jersey. His brain is removed during an autopsy for scientific study, and his ashes are scattered at an undisclosed location.</li>
        </ul>
